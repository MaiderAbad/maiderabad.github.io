[{"content":" Hi 👋\nI\u0026rsquo;m Maider “Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.” - Benjamin Franklin 🧬 About me # I am fascinated by combining disciplines to provide an integrated and complete solution. Probably for that reason, I decided to study Biomedical Engineering, which allowed me to merge the more technical parts of engineering and medicine. In the last year of my degree and after my stay at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, I decided to specialize in imaging and artificial intelligence. Therefore, after completing my master\u0026rsquo;s degree, I decided to pursue a Ph.D. in computer vision to diagnose diseases by analyzing medical images. I consider myself a hard-working person with time management skills since I have always combined studies with work. I hold a cheerful, proactive, and decisive personality that easily adapts to different environments.\n🌍 I was born in Bilbao and currently live in Barcelona, Spain\n👾 Skills # Machine Learning AI Python Shell Scripting MySQL MatLab R Computer Vision TensorFlow Keras PyTorch Docker NumPy Pandas OpenCV matplotlib scikit-learn Git Download CV Might not be super up-to-date, for that, please refer to my LinkedIn profile # Feel free to contact me via email ✉️ ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/about/","section":"Maider Abad","summary":"About me","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/","section":"Maider Abad","summary":"","title":"Maider Abad"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
